SETUP:
1) Must be running XAMPP version 7.2 or later (PHP 7.2 or later). If using an older version the survey may/will produce errors.
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

2) Copy files in the subdirectory "php files" to xampp/htdocs, e.g. C:\xampp\htdocs

3) Open xampp and start Apache and MySQL service. If not using default port(80) append the port you are using to the URL in the next step

4) Go to 'http://localhost/' you will be automatically redirected to the about.php page

5) If the database does not already exist you will be prompted to create it.

6) From here you can sign up, create surveys, answer the default survey view results etc.

TO DO:
- Improve use of superglobals (make site more secure)
- Add graphs
- Improve default date question
- Finish and add competitors write-up

EXTRA:
I have included my requirements as a .docx

I have not yet finished my analysis of other websites and as such it is not found in the competitors.php. The unfinished version can be found in: Competitors.docx.
